### Execution:

To begin the simulation, start a terminal window and launch the Spherebot Node. This command execution should take about 20sec to complete and finish with the Gazebo client GUI displaying the Spherebot within his world.

```
$ roslaunch pde4430_cw2 rover_gazebo_teleop.launch
```
 
```
$ gzclient
```


```
$ roslaunch pde4430_cw2 rover_gazebo.launch
```

PS: Not everything is working as it should, for example the gmapping. Robot build could have been better, i built another one but due to bad time managment was not able to implement it to this world. Video also not available.

Future:

For the future i will execute better time management and try to practice more on gazebo, whenever i am free

Youtube has helped a lot while doing.
